# Welcome to the Cotton Molecular Biology Lab

We are excited to launch our new website! The Cotton Molecular Biology Lab at the University of Georgia focuses on advancing cotton breeding through cutting-edge molecular techniques and genomics research.

## Our Research Focus

Our lab integrates traditional breeding methods with modern genomic tools to:

- Develop superior fiber quality in upland cotton
- Enhance resistance to root-knot nematodes
- Explore wild gene resources for stress tolerance
- Implement high-throughput genotyping and genomic selection

## Join Our Team

We are always looking for motivated students and post-docs who are passionate about plant breeding and genomics. Our lab offers opportunities to work on:

- Quantitative genetics and mixed-model analysis
- High-throughput DNA/RNA sequencing
- Bioinformatics and computational biology
- Field phenotyping and breeding

## Recent Achievements

- Published high-impact papers in Plant Biotechnology Journal and Theoretical and Applied Genetics
- Developed novel germplasm with improved fiber traits
- Secured funding from USDA-AFRI and Cotton Incorporated
- Established collaborations with international research institutions

Stay tuned for more updates on our research progress and upcoming events!
